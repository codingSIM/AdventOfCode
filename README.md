My answers and attempts of solving the Advent of Code puzzles.

## input.txt

Due to the legal implications of using the actual puzzle inputs generated by Advent Of Code website in this repository, I have had to remove the input.txt files of the puzzles.

However to work around this, I will try to add my own similar inputs to give you an idea on what kind of input was expected.

## Improvement

After solving the puzzles myself, I will look at other solutions and try to get to understand them. 

This is to help me improve in the future and learn something new.
